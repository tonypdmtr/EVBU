<P>The port pins of the 68HC11 interact with the user via the waveform I/O panel. On
this panel, an interface similar to that of a logic analyzer is presented. Each
port pin uses a horizontal window to display its logic level as a function of time.
For output pins, every change in logic level generates a rising or falling edge in
the window, at the right time (measured in cycles). For input pins, a separate text
file is constructed by the user and loaded into the waveform I/O panel, where it is
displayed just like an output waveform. During simulation, this input file provides
a logic level stimulus to the input port pin, once again with times measured in
cycles.

<A NAME="Display"><!-- --></A>
<H2>The Display Panel</H2>
<P>When the parallel I/O peripheral module is loaded (unless <TT>--no-pio</TT>
is specified as a command-line option) a waveform I/O display panel is
presented along with the main BUFFALO command window. If the display panel
fails to display, it probably means that wxPython is not correctly installed,
wxWindows is not correctly installed, or something similar. Check the displayed
error messages for clues.

<P>If this is your first time using the waveform I/O panel, I suggest creating
a new waveform so you can investigate the options as you are reading this
text. Select the <TT>Waveform-&gt;Add Waveform...</TT> menu, click on PA0 at
the top of the Port Pin list box, then click the Browse button near the
bottom right. Find the <TT>EXAMPLE.STI</TT> file that came with the EVBU
software. Click OK to dismiss the dialog. You should see a new waveform
in the display panel labelled PA0.

<P>Each waveform is split into two windows, the label window on the left and
the data window on the right. In the data window, the logic level of the port
pin is shown as a function of time (in cycles). The yellow tick marks in the
data window represent <B><I>divisions</I></B>. The number of cycles in one
division is given by the <B><I>Scale</I></B> value near the top of the panel.
Try adjusting the Scale text box to 1000 and see how the waveform changes
in appearance. The yellow tick marks don't change in spacing or position,
but the waveform expands and compresses.

<P>The spacing of the tick marks can be changed using the <B><I>Zoom</I></B>
value of the panel. The Zoom text box changes the number of pixels between
each tick mark. The combination of Zoom and Scale serve to set (indirectly)
the number of pixels per cycle, although this quantity is not manipulated
directly. Try clicking on the Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Zoom All buttons.
The latter is useful for viewing your whole waveform.
<P>Note that the Zoom buttons do not affect the Scale. You may need to
modify both Scale and Zoom to get a satisfactory view of your waveform.

<P>The <B><I>Start Time</I></B> is used to shift the waveform to the
left or right. The Start Time can be modified in three ways: by setting
a value (in cycles) directly in the text box, by clicking the +Div or
-Div buttons, which shift the waveform by one division, or by clicking
on the Zero button which returns the start time to 0. Note that
the Shift-Right and Shift-Left key combinations can also be used
instead of the +Div and -Div buttons. Similarly, Ctrl-Z zeros the
start time.

<P>Note that the View menu duplicates many of the button interfaces
on the panel.

<P>Once a waveform is displayed, right-clicking somewhere in the
waveform displays a pop-up menu where many useful actions can be
performed. The waveform can be deleted, edited (the dialog is brought
up again where the port pin and stimulus file, if applicable, can
be changed), and other functions (described below).

<P>Double clicking (with the left button) on a waveform automatically
brings up the edit dialog.

<A NAME="Outputs"><!-- --></A>
<H2>Output Waveforms</H2>
<P>While reading this section, you may find it useful to create a Port A
pin 6 waveform (PA6) and to load the <TT>EX1.S19</TT> file for simulation.

<P>Output waveforms are displayed with a black background in the display
panel. When an output-only pin is selected in the Add Waveform... dialog,
the Stimulus File box in this dialog is disabled to indicate that stimulus
only applies to input pins.

<P>Port pins that are bidirectional will have the Stimulus File text box
enabled. Note the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A bidirectional pin with the Stimulus File text box left empty will
be considered an output pin.
<LI>A bidirectional pin with the Stimulus File text box non-empty will
be considered an input pin.
</UL>
<P>Currently, there is no way to reverse a pin's direction in the middle
of simulation. It is possible, however, to instantiate two separate
waveforms of the same port pin, one as input and one as output (assuming
the pin is bidirectional).

<P>As an illustration, create the PA6 waveform, as suggested above,
and load the <TT>EX1.S19</TT> file using the <TT>LOAD</TT> BUFFALO
command. Then, type <TT>GO 1040</TT> to begin simulation. Once
simulation completes, switch to the waveform I/O panel and press
the Zoom All button. You should see three edges generated on PA6,
approximately 2000 cycles apart (setting the Scale to 1000 makes this
easier to see). Study the <TT>EX1.C</TT> file to see how the source
corresponds to the observed output.

<A NAME="Inputs"><!-- --></A>
<H2>Input Waveforms</H2>

<P>While reading this section, you may find it useful to create a Port A
pin 0 waveform (PA0) and to load the <TT>EX2.S19</TT> file for simulation.
For PA0, set the stimulus file to <TT>EX2.STI</TT> from the EVBU
source distribution.

<P>Input waveforms are displayed with a grey background in the
display panel. When an input or bidirectional pin is selected
in the Add Waveform... dialog, the Stimulus File box in this dialog
is enabled to allow you to specify a stimulus file that defines the
waveform. As mentioned in the previous section, if the Stimulus File
text box is left blank for a bidirectional pin, the pin is assumed
to be an output, otherwise it is assumed to be an input.

<P>The format of a stimulus file is simple: it is a plain text file
with two columns. The first column is the cycle number, the second
is the value of the waveform at that cycle time. For example:</P>
<PRE>
0 0
100 1
900 0
1000 1
</PRE>
<P>This stimulus file begins the waveform with 0, then a rising edge
occurs at cycle 100, a falling edge at cycle 900, and a final
rising edge at cycle 1000.

<P>Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' (comment lines) are ignored.
The cycle times must be written in strictly ascending order. Cycle times
must be written in base 10.

<P>Examine the <TT>EX2.STI</TT> file and use it as stimulus for
Port A pin 0 (PA0) before you run the <TT>EX2.S19</TT> example
file (see <TT>EX2.C</TT> for the source code). This example should
clarify the above concepts.

<P>Once the stimulus file is loaded, further changes to the file are
<B><I>not</I></B> automatically reflected in the stimulus waveform. To effect
a change, the waveform must be <B><I>reloaded</I></B> from the
source file. This can be accomplished by right-clicking on the waveform
and selecting Reload Stimulus from the pop-up menu.

<A NAME="Simulation"><!-- --></A>
<H2>Simulation Details</H2>
<P>The waveform I/O display is tied to the cycle counter of the simulator.
Note that this is not the same as the TCNT timer counter register. The
simulator maintains its own cycle count that does not roll over beyond
0xFFFF as it has many more bits of precision (in fact, it is a Python
'long' type hence has a really really large number of bits). Note that
the <TT>CYC</TT> BUFFALO command manipulates the simulator's cycle
count, hence the waveform I/O cycle count is also affected.

<P>In practice, it is expected that programs are started with the <TT>GO</TT>
command. This serves to automatically reset the cycle counter to 0. For
waveform I/O, this means that input stimulus files are applied starting
at a cycle number of 0, and that output waveforms are cleared (i.e., all
previous output activity is discarded).

<P>All of the other methods of resuming program execution (e.g., the <TT>P</TT>
command, the <TT>STOPAT</TT> command, etc.) do not reset the cycle counter
and simply cause waveform I/O to continue where the last cycle count left off.

<A NAME="Cursors"><!-- --></A>
<H2>Cursors</H2>
<P>The waveform display supports two cursors (or markers, as they are sometimes
called) that can help locate events and measure the relative times of two
events. A cursor is simply a vertical line that appears on all waveform
windows and whose location (in time, measured in cycles) appears at the top
right of the panel window. The difference in time between the two cursors
is displayed in the C2-C1 box.

<P>By default, the cursors are not displayed. Both cursor 1 and cursor 2 may
be displayed manually from the View menu (or by the shorcut keys Ctrl-1 and
Ctrl-2) or by right-clicking on a waveform and selecting one of the items
from the pop-up menu.

<P>The <TT>EX1.S19</TT> example from above may be helpful at this point.
Create a PA6 waveform and run <TT>EX1.S19</TT> from address 0x1040. Click
the Zoom All button to see the whole waveform. Just prior to the first rising
edge, right-click on the waveform and select Cursor 1 Here. You will see
a red cursor appear where you clicked. You will see the time location of
cursor 1 in the C1 text box at the top right.

<P>The cursors may be moved manually by left-clicking and dragging the
top of the cursor (i.e., the pointer-shaped thingy).

<P>Right-click again on the waveform (anywhere) and select Cursor 2 Here.
A cyan cursor should appear, and you should see the difference in time
between the two cursors in the C2-C1 box.

<P>Another interesting way of positioning the cursors is by &quot;snapping&quot;
them to an edge. Right-click again just prior to the first rising edge
and select Cursor 1 to Next Edge. Cursor 1 will automatically move to the
exact cycle of the next rising (or falling) edge of the waveform. Repeat
this step for cursor 2 just prior to the subsequent falling edge. You
will see that the duration of the pulse is (C2-C1) 2043 cycles.
