This file briefly describes the files in the EVBU/demo subdirectory.

Compilation Notes
=================

Note that all source files are accompanied by S19 files that are ready for
loading into the simulator. You do not need to compile the C files yourself.
They are there just for reference. In case you do want to recreate the S19
files, however, the notes below may be of use.

The C source files were compiled with my own distribution of the GCC 68HC11
port. See the following URL if you are interested in my distribution:

http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/courses/226/index.html#GCC6811Stuff

The original GCC 68HC11 port can be obtained from:

http://home.worldnet.fr/~stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html

My distribution comes with a BUFFALO library (libbuffalo.a) that exposes some
of the BUFFALO service routines as C function calls and provides the
<buffalo.h> include file.  There are also slight modifications to the linker
scripts to speed up simulation, as well as a memory.x memory map file suitable
for use on 68HC11 systems with external RAM up to 0x7FFF.

The command line used to compile each of the C files is documented in the
makefile in this directory. If you download and use my GCC 68HC11 distribution,
you should be able to recreate the S19 files exactly.

Demo Files
==========

Only the source files are listed below. Each source file has an accompanying
S19 file that is ready for loading into the simulator and a .S file that
is the assembler output from the compiler. There are also .STI files
that sometimes accompany programs. These are stimulus files for the
various waveforms used by the programs. See the header documentation in
each file for instructions on how to run the program and how to assign
the stimulus files.
