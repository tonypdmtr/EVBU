Description:
        EVBU is a simulator for the 68HC11 microcontroller. It also emulates
        the BUFFALO interface, as is found on the Motorola 68HC11 EVBU and
        other similar hardware systems.

        Logic levels on I/O port pins are displayed graphically.

        To run the program, invoke the Python interpreter on the evbu.py file.
        On Windows, create a desktop shortcut to the file evbu/evbu.py

        For Windows, you can directly type the Python script name if you first
        do the following from an Administrator Console:

        assoc .py=Python.File
        python.file="C:\Windows\py.exe" "%L" %*
