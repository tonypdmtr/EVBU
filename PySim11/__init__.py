# These constants are used in the branch-force mechanism of the step() function.
# if the branchForce parameter of the step() function is BFORCE_ALWAYS, the
# current instruction, if a branch, is unconditionally taken. Similarly,
# BFORCE_NEVER causes the current instruction, if a branch, to not be taken.
BFORCE_ALWAYS = 1
BFORCE_NEVER  = 2
